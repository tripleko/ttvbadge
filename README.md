TTV Badge extension for Chrome enables custom badges (as a reward for channel regulars or etc.) in broadcaster enabled twitch.tv channels.

Relevant links: [broadcaster edit page](https://badge.tripleko.com) and the [chrome web store extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ttv-badge/podclmgfenpgaadnciibmgioeefkgpbi).

Extension source files are included here - backend is not currently. My stack as of now includes: nginx, node.js, express, mongodb, and knockout.js (and a guilty sprinkle of jquery when convenient).
