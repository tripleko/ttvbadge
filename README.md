TTV Badge extension for Chrome enables custom badges (as a reward for channel regulars or etc.) in broadcaster enabled [twitch.tv](twitch.tv) channels.

Relevant links: [broadcaster edit page](https://badge.tripleko.com) and the [Chrome web store extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ttv-badge/podclmgfenpgaadnciibmgioeefkgpbi).

Extension source files are included here - backend is currently not.

My stack as of now includes:
* nginx
* node.js
* express
* mongodb
* knockout.js
* jQuery (a guilty sprinkle)
